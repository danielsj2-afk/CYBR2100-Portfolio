# Program Portfolio

Welcome! This site collects my weekly artifacts for **Cyber Ethics & Cyber Law**. Each week adds one public page with my work, sources, and a short reflection.

> **How to read this site:** Click a week card below. Each page includes the required sections, evidence links (PDFs/docs), and an AI-use note where relevant.

## Start Here
- **Syllabus →** *(link in Blackboard)*
- **Course portfolio instructions →** *(see Weekly Portfolio prompts in Blackboard)*
- **Submission rule:** Publish your week page and **submit that page’s public URL in Blackboard** by **Saturday 6:00 PM ET**.

## How I Use AI for This Course
I may use AI tools for brainstorming or editing. I will document the **tool name**, **prompts**, and **my edits** in an **AI Use Note** on each page. I am responsible for fact-checking and originality.

## Evidence Conventions
- Files live in `evidence/wXX/` (e.g., `evidence/w01/Reflection.pdf`).
- Links use relative paths and descriptive text (e.g., **Reflection PDF**).
- No PII, credentials, tokens, or internal screenshots on public pages.
